I have to build a timed code quiz with multiple choice questions. Using javascript to change HTML elements and CSS dynamically. The score is set to be the amount of time left. Every wrong answer user has will take 10 seconds away from the time clock. Using local storage to save the name and score from the last time user played. This app is quite challenging.
